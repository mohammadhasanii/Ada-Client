It is where your code execution begins. \\n* **`fmt.Println(\\Hello, World!\\`**: This calls the `Println` function from the `fmt` package, which prints a string to the console followed by a newline character (`\\\\n`).  \\n* **`var name string = \\Golang\\**: This declares a variable named `name` of type `string` and assigns it the value \\Golang\\ \\n* **`fmt.Printf(\\My Name is: %s\\\\n\\ name)`**: This uses `Printf` to format the output based on placeholders (`%s`). The placeholder `%s` represents a string variable, and we are passing `name`.  \\n\\n**How to run this code:**\\n\\n1. **Save the code:** Create a new file (e.g., `hello.go`) and paste the code into it.\\n2. **Compile:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run: \\n   `go build hello.go`\\n3. **Run:** Execute the compiled binary with:  `./hello`\\n\\n\\nThis simple example demonstrates some basic syntax and functionality in Go.
